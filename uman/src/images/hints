If you double-click the cell where the row with an MP3 file and the column for MP3s cross, you can immediately set up your song file.<br><br>This works also für pictures and videos.
You can edit the value of each tag in the details area in the upper right. Just double-click to enter edit mode.
You can modify the order in which tags are saved to a song file by drag&drop these tags under "Options->Tag Save Order".
Did you remark that "tasks area" on the middle right? Just check the things you want to do, select some songs and then click on the start-button.
You can hide the event log to the lower right by unchecking "Show Event Log" in the "Options" menu.
Do you want me to say something else? Tell everybody your requests on our <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/uman">SourceForge project website</a>.
Some tags are missing? Yeah, that's right. Several data stays unchanged because this tool doesn't enable you to modify GAP or BPM a.s.o.<br><br>You can use UltraStar itself very well for that.
Did I hear you correctly? A missing feature?! Just click <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/uman">here</a> and tell it everyone - especially the developers.
You can also send a mail to <a href="mailto:saiya_mg@users.sourceforge.net">any developer</a> and give feedback.
The "Songs" menu enables you to expand or collapse the whole song tree. That means you will either see only directories of your songs or all files you can use.
You are missing a video for your favourite song? Check out <a href="http://www.youtube.com">Youtube</a>!
Whenever a task could not be done you can see it in the event log to the lower right. Mostly a file could not be found or invalid characters are used to rename something.<br><br>Be aware that UltraStar can display more characters than you can use under Windows for a file.
Did you notice that there are green and blue ticks for the song tree? Blue ones tell you that your song directory is named correctly after "Artist - Title" not case-sensitive while green ones are case-sensitive.
The chain beside a picture, audio or video file signals you that it can be found by UltraStar correctly.<br><br>You can reset chains by double-click the correct column.
Files are unused by UltraStar whenever they appear gray.
You want to know how many songs you've got? Well...there are <b>%1 songs</b>. Not bad at all.<br><br>Did you get a cover, a background or a video for each one? No? Then you've got a new task.
