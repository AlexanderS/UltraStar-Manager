If you double-click the cell where the row of an audio file and the <i>audio column</i> cross, you can immediately set your song to use this audio file in UltraStar.<br><br>This also works for cover and background images as well as video files.
You can edit the value of most tags in the details area. Just double-click the right cell there to enter the edit mode of a specific value.
You can modify the order in which tags are saved to a song file by dragging & dropping these tags under <i>Options &rarr; Tag Save Order...</i>.

Do you want me to say something else? Tell everybody about your requests in our <a href="http://forum.ultra-star.de/viewforum.php?f=62">project forum</a>.
The BPM tag is not editable? Yeah, that's right. This is not a song creation tool like the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/usc">UltraStar Creator</a>. Nevertheless, you can modify all lyrics and correct spelling errors.
Did I hear you correctly? A missing feature?! Just click <a href="http://forum.ultra-star.de/viewforum.php?f=62">here</a> and let everybody know - especially the developers.
The <i>Songs</i> menu enables you to expand or collapse the whole song tree. That means you will either see only directories of your songs or all files you can use.
You are missing a video for your favourite song? Check out <a href="http://www.youtube.com">Youtube</a>, <a href="http://www.dailymotion.com">Dailymotion</a>, or <a href="http://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>!
Whenever a task could not be applied, you can find a corresponding entry in the event log. Mostly a file could not be found or invalid characters (e.g. '?') are used to rename something.<br><br>Be aware that <i>UltraStar</i> can display more characters than you can use on <i>Windows</i> for a file.
Did you notice that there are green, yellow, and red smileys in the song tree? Green ones tell you that your song directory is named correctly after <i>Artist - Title</i> case-sensitive while yellow ones only match case-insensitive. The red smileys indicate an entirely wrong combination.
The <i>chain</i> beside a picture, audio or video file indicates that it can be found by UltraStar correctly.<br><br>You can reset chains by double-clicking the correct column.
Files are unused by UltraStar whenever they are displayed in gray.
You want to know how many songs you have in your collection? Well, there are <b>%1 songs</b>. Not bad at all.<br><br>Did you get a cover, a background or a video for each one? No? Then you've got a new task.
Hmmm... just in case you did not notice: The last events are located at the top of the event log.
Did you remark these nice tooltips at the header of each column in the song tree? There are more tooltips at nearly every button here.
Do you wonder why some tasks want to rename your file into <i>something.*</i>?<br><br>Well, your file suffix is preserved whatever it may be. So don't bother.
The first *.txt or *.txd file in any subdirectory of your song folder will be recognized as a song and listed in the song tree. Other song files will be so-called <i>friends</i> to this primary song. You can switch the primary song with double-clicking the file.
There is a song missing which is found by UltraStar instead? That's impossible!<br><br>Well... please report it on the <a href="http://forum.ultra-star.de/viewforum.php?f=62">project forum</a> and include details where that song is located.
You can turn off these relative paths in the folder column by unchecking <i>View &rarr; Relative Song Path</i>.
What are <b><font color="royalblue">blue folders</font></b>? If a tag is found in a song text file that will not be recognized by UltraStar then this song is marked with a blue folder.<br><br>That's not bad at all. These tags will stay untouched by default. However, you can either add them using <i>Options &rarr; Custom tags...</i> or use a dedicated task to remove all unknown tags, if you want.
The tooltip of a blue folder shows all unsupported tags found in the corresponding song file.
Try to click on an audio file and see what appears in the preview window...
Did you notice the large number of default values for a genre in the song details? These genres originate from the good old ID3v1 specification as well as some custom Winamp extensions.
I shall be quiet? Then uncheck me <i>in the top right corner of the main menu</i>.
The default values for an artist, a title and the year in the song details are taken from the ID3 tag.
There is a task that enables you to set up missing files for a song automatically. That task looks for the first proper files (audio, picture, video) and uses that file if the present entry is invalid or missing.
Some details can be edited simultaneously for a selection of songs. Simply select some songs and use the <i>details table</i>.

You can make a dockable widget (song details, tasks, event log) floatable if you double-click on its title bar.
Did you remark that the state of the application window as well as all dockable widgets is saved on exit?
Unsupported tags will be saved after all other tags in the song file. You can create these tags as <i>custom tags</i> via <i>Options &rarr; Custom tags...</i> and then specify their save order in <i>Options &rarr; Tag save order...</i>.
You have a problem with changing the artist tag because the auto completion wants to use the ID3 tag value? (e.g. "abba" &rarr; "Abba")<br><br>Try to check <i>Use case-sensitive auto completion</i> in the details table.
If you double-click a text file, you'll see its contents.
Did you know that you can drag one or more files from the <i>file explorer</i> onto a song in the tree to <i>copy</i> and use/assign this or these files automatically for that song?
Files that appear <font color="gray"><s>striked-out and gray</s></font> cannot be used anywhere and are useless to UltraStar.
Did you know that there is a context-menu in the song tree? Try to right-click on a file or a song directory and see what happens...
You can delete a single file by pushing the delete key on your keyboard or choosing <i>Delete</i> in the context menu of that file.<br><br><b>Attention! You can delete song text files!</b>
If you drag & drop a song text file from your explorer into the song tree (not at an item), a new folder will be created and your file will be copied to that new location.<br><br>So you can easily add new songs to your collection.
Whenever a folder appears <b>bold</b>, there are unsaved changes. Don't forget to save them or turn on <i>Options &rarr; Auto-Save</i>!
You can filter the song tree. Just hit <i>Ctrl+F</i> and type some regular expression. Then press the filter button.

You can delete a rename task by deleting its configuration file in the <tt>plugins/config/rename</tt> subdirectory.

There is a context menu in the task list which enables you to add and edit rename tasks.
Some operations cannot be cancelled because that would lead to an inconsistent state, e.g. applying a filter.
You can expand and collapse the categories in the database info window by double-clicking their names.
A cross with an exclamation mark in the song tree indicates that the value for a file-related tag (e.g. #COVER) was set but the file does not exist.
A song file is <b>invalid</b> if one of the artist, title, or BPM tag is missing, or if is has a length of zero. That song will have a <font style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #FFD6D6">&nbsp;light red or pink background&nbsp;</font> in the song tree.
If you want to integrate new songs via drag & drop in the song tree, it may be helpful to hide all other songs first.<br><br><i>Hide &rarr; All</i> (context menu).
There are two types of context menus in the song tree. One for files and one for folders (entire songs).
You can negate the regular expression for a filter if you click the magnifier button in front of the input line.
If you filter "abba|akon|dido", you will get all items that contain "abba", "akon" or "dido".
Nearly all icons in the song tree have a tooltip. Just let the mouse cursor hover and wait a couple of seconds. A hint will appear.
You can see duplicate songs if you press <i>Duplicates</i> in the filter/search area. Duplicate songs will be listed together.

If you right-click in the lyrics of the media player while a song is playing, you can jump to the lyrics editor and correct a spelling error or typo.
You can jump to any position in a song in the media player.
